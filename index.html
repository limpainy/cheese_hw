                <p class="cheese_txt">is a soft cow's-milk cheese named after Brie,
                     the French region from which it originated. 
                     It is pale in color with a slight grayish tinge under a rind of white mould. 
                     The rind is typically eaten, with its flavor depending largely upon the ingredients used and its manufacturing environment. 
                     It is similar to Camembert, which is native to a different region of France. 
                     Brie typically contains between 60% and 75% butterfat, slightly higher than Camembert.

                <p class="cheese_txt">is a hard, salty Italian cheese made with sheep's milk that is often used for grating over pasta or other dishes. 
                    The name pecorino simply means 'ovine' or 'of sheep' in Italian; 
                    the name of the cheese, although protected, is a description rather than a brand: 
                    formaggio pecorino romano simply means 'sheep's cheese of Rome'.

                    <p class="cheese_txt"> is a natural cheese that is relatively hard, off-white, and sometimes sharp-tasting. 
                        It originates from the English village of Cheddar in Somerset, southwest England.
                        Cheddar is produced all over the world, and cheddar cheese has no Protected Designation of Origin. 
                        In 2007, the name West Country Farmhouse Cheddar was registered in the European Union and 
                        the United Kingdom, defined as cheddar produced from local milk within Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall and manufactured using traditional methods. 
                        Protected Geographical Indication was registered for Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar in 2013 in the EU, which also applies under UK law.

                <p class="cheese_txt">is a moist, soft, creamy, surface-ripened cow's milk cheese. 
                    It was first made in the late 18th century in Camembert, Normandy, in northwest France. 
                    It is sometimes compared in look and taste to brie cheese, 
                    albeit with a slightly lower butterfat content than brie's typical 20% â€“ 25% by weight.

                <p class="cheese_name">Manchego cheese</p>
                <p class="cheese_txt"> is a cheese made in the La Mancha region of Spain from the milk of sheep of the Manchega breed. 
                    It is aged between 60 days and 2 years. Manchego has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, 
                    often containing small, unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow,
                     and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour,
                      well developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep's milk.
